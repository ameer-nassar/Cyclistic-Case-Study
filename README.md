## Tools Used
- **R** (tidyverse, ggplot2)
- **RStudio**
- **CSV Files for data storage and analysis**

## Process
### 1. Data Loading
- Loaded quarterly Divvy trip datasets from 2019 and Q1 2020.
- Combined all datasets into a single master dataset.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Converted timestamps to date objects.
- Calculated **ride length** for each trip.
- Filtered out invalid trips (negative durations).

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed ride counts by user type and day of the week.
- Compared average ride lengths across user types and days.
- Identified seasonal patterns and membership trends.

### 4. Visualizations
- **Bar Chart:** Total rides by day of the week.
- **Line Chart:** Average ride length by day.
- **Bar Chart:** Total rides by user type.
- Visuals exported to PNG for easy sharing.

## Key Insights
- **Casual riders** ride more on weekends.
- **Annual members** ride more on weekdays.
- Casual riders take longer rides on average, indicating more leisure activity.
- Membership marketing could target casual riders who ride often but havenâ€™t subscribed yet.

## Conclusion
The analysis supports targeted marketing strategies focused on converting high-frequency casual riders into members and ensuring bike availability during peak hours (weekends for casual riders, weekdays for members).
